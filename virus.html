A virus is a small infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to bacteria and archaea.

A virus is a microscopic organism that can replicate only inside the cells of a host organism. Most viruses are so tiny they are only observable with at least a conventional optical microscope. Viruses infect all types of organisms, including animals and plants, as well as bacteria and archaea. Approximately 5000 different viruses have been described in detail at the current time, although it is known that there are millions of distinct types.[1]  Viruses are found in virtually every ecosystem on Earth, and these minute life forms are thought to be the most abundant type of biological entity.[2]  The study of viruses is known as virology, a specialty within the field of  microbiology.<img src="http://content61.eol.org/content/2012/10/01/18/49247_orig.jpg"></img>

The common concept of viruses focuses on their role as pathogen. Actually, there are vast numbers of viral entities that are beneficial to individual species as well as providing ecosystem services. For example, a class of viruses known as bacteriophages can kill a spectrum of harmful bacteria, providing protection to humans as well as other biota.

<h2>Replication</h2>
<p>The virus, totally dependent upon its host for reproduction, manifests six essential stages in its life cycle:

<b>Attachment</b> is the intermolecular binding between viral capsid proteins and receptors on the outer membrane of the host cell. The specificity of binding determines the host species and cell types that are receptive to viral infection. For example, HIV infects only human T cells, because the surface protein interacts with CD4 and chemokine receptors on the surface of the T cell itself. This mechanism is thought to have evolved to discriminate in favor of those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the outer host cell membrane may induce the viral-envelope protein to undergo changes that result in the fusion of virus and host cell membranes.

<b>Viral entry</b> is the next step, wherein a virus penetrates the host cell wall. In the case of plant cells, the cell outer membrane is composed of cellulose, such that cell wall trauma must be usually precedent; however, certain plant viruses (for example, tobacco mosaic virus) can pass from cell to cell through plasmodesmata, or pore structures. Also, bacteria have significantly strong cell walls. Some viruses have evolved mechanisms that inject their DNA or RNA into a bacterium, with the viral capsid remaining outside.
<b>Uncoating</b> is the step in which viral enzymes degrade the virus capsid; sometimes host enzymes also play a role in this dissolution, that then exposes the viral genome to the interior of the host cell's chemical factory.
<b>Replication</b> is the actual synthesis of (i) the virus messenger RNA (except for the case of positive sense RNA); (ii) synthesis of virus proteins; and (iii) assembly of replicated genomic material and subsequent protein binding.

Post-translational modification of viral proteins sometimes transpires. For example, in the case of HIV, such a step (often termed maturation) happens once the virus has escaped out of the host cell.
<b>Lysis</b> is the final step, in which the host cell dies through the act of its membrane being burst by the viral escape. In some cases the new virus genome becomes dormant in the host, only to come to life at a later time, when the activated virus subsequently lyses.
